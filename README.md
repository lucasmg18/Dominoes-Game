# Dominoes-Game
## Introduction and Motivation
This repository consists of my first programming project made in my first year of the double degree in Computer Science and Mathematics. With this project I learned how to program the basics in C++.  
## Videogame
It is a terminal - based videogame of the classic Dominoes made in C++.  
It has multiple functionalities like **saving** and **loading** games, up to **4 local multiplayer**, **AI adversaries** to play with and others that can be activated through constants inside the main C++ code such as the difficulty of the AI adversaries.  

## Files
The executable already compiled and ready to be played can be downloaded in the file [Domino Final](https://github.com/lucasmg18/Dominoes-Game/blob/main/Domino_Final.exe) of this repository.  
The C++ code is also available in the file [Domino Final Code](https://github.com/lucasmg18/Dominoes-Game/blob/main/Domino_Final_Code.cpp) of this repository.
